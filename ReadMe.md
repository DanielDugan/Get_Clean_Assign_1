* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

There is a codebook attached as well as sample output files.
